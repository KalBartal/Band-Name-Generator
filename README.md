# Band Name Generator

This is my coding challenge submission for day #1 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This simple application takes 2 inputs and generates a band name from them. 

## Usage

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.

What's the name of the city you grew up in?
What's your pet's name?

Your band name could be + street + pet.
```
